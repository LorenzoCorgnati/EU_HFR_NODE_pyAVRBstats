    "description": "The application performs basic statistics on the radial bearing angles of High Frequency Radar radial site time series in order to support the selection of the Average Radial Bearing QC test's thresholds. In particular, for each radial site of the input HFR network, plots are generated for the time series of the radial vector average bearing and for the overall distribution of the radial vector bearings.",
